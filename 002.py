# Now, let's try some simple math.  Say we want to add two simple numbers,
# 1 + 2, to get an output of 3.

print(1 + 2)

# This code simple finds what 1 + 2 is, and finds 3.  Then, it passes the
# answer to the "print" function, which we learned last lesson.  So, the
# program prints 1 + 2, which is 3.

print("1 + 2")

# If we were to run this code however, the system would print out the string,
# "1 + 2", and it won't try to find 1 + 2, because that wasn't what was given.
