# Now, let's learn about saving information for later.  This is called using
# variables.  Variables store information for you to use and change later.
# Let's go back to our 1 + 2 problem from lesson 002.

x = 1
y = 2
print(x + y)

# Here, we've assigned the variable "x" to be equal to 1, and the variable "y"
# to be equal to 2.  We called these variables just by typing their names,
# so that the program will just make it "print(1 + 2)".

x = 1
y = x + 1
print(x + y)

# This code makes "x" equal to 1, and "y" equal to "x" + 1.  This is the same
# as 1 + 1, which is 2, so "y" is now equal to 2, making it the same as the
# last section of code.
