# So, we've been doing a lot of addition in our examples.  We know it's very
# simple, all you have to do is put a "+" between two numbers.  The other
# operations are just as simple to use.

x = 4
y = 2

# Here's addition:
print(x + y)

# Here's subtraction:
print(x - y)

# Here's multiplication:
print(x * y)

# Here's division:
print(x / y)

# Notice how, when run, the answer to the division problem is 2, instead of
# just 2.  That's because 2 is an integer, and division returns a float, which
# has a decimal.  What if we want to just have 2?

print(x // y)

# This code uses integer division, so it does the same thing as the last
# division example, but with the second "/", it rounds the answer down to the
# last whole number.
