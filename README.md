## How to use
Clone this repository to your computer, navigate to the "lessons" folder, and go through the scripts one at a time.
Each script will have comments denoted by pound signs, and they will explain the script.
### Verifying if Python is installed
*Mac operating systems come with Python pre-installed.*
1. Go to your terminal, such as Terminal for Mac, or Command Prompt for Windows.
2. Type "python" and press enter.
If your terminal's prompt is now three arrows, you have Python installed on your system.
If you do not see three arrows, or you receive an error, you most likely do not have Python installed on your system.  See [the next section](#installing-python) for help installing Python.
### Installing Python
1. First, visit [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Then, under "Downloads", click the button to download the latest version of Python that begins with 3.
3. Follow the instructions in the installer to set up Python, and if given an option, ensure Python is added to the PATH variable.
